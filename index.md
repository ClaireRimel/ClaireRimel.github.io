I’m a software developer specialised in iOS development. 

Following a career change from sales/marketing, I started my software developer career in 2018 by taking a one-year iOS development course at OpenClassrooms (online platform). My studies covered iOS and computer science topics, as learning about the Swift language fundamentals, OOP, POP, MVC architecture, UML, REST APIs and unit testing, taking the knowledge to practice by building several training iOS apps, using Git for version control and GitHub, where all their repositories are publicly available.

Today, I’m part of the iOS team at Trigo Technologies, a software development company which builds internal projects and does client work.

While always appreciating having international experiences, I’ve had to face the double challenge of being immerse in a multicultural and Spanish speaking working environment, as well as being part of a fully remote and distributed team, having colleagues from Caracas, Moscow, Paris and Santiago de Chile.

At Trigo Technologies, I’m currently contributing to the development of the Cupo Express iOS application, which is written in Swift 5 based on Clean architecture. Cupo Express is a web/mobile application which allows users to make money donations to both particulars and non-profit organisations by using Transbank’s OnePay platform, one of the main chilean online payment services. App features include managing a users accounts system for both web and mobile, allowing also offline usage (by using CoreData for local data storage) and push notification reception (by using the Firebase SDK). A unit test suite has been written using the native XCTest framework.

My side projects cover the development of the iOS application UFConvertor, which is available on the AppStore (https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/ufconvertor/id1517422326). It fetches the daily UF currency value using a public REST API, data which is displayed in both the iOS app and a Today Extension using Charts, an open source framework for data visualisation display. I chose CocoaPods as the dependency manager. I also contributed to the open source project Say Their Names (https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/say-their-names/id1517599626?l=en) by adding French localisations to the iOS application.
